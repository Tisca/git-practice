                    <h3>Be kind to yourself</h3>
                    <p>Learning to code is a journey. Take your time.<br>
                        Don't talk to yourself in a way you would never talk
                        to a loved one.</p>
                    <h3>Try to practice every day</h3>
                    <p>Plan small time units, an ammount of time that feels doable.<br>
                        Don't overwhelm yourself trying to learn it all at once.</p>
                    <h3>Celebrate your successes</h3>
                    <p>You know more today than you did a year ago. Realize how far you've come!</p>
